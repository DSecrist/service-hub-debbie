                <div><strong>What is a Tire Blowout&#63;</strong> Tire “Blowout” is a general term used by drivers to describe a bursting tire during movement accompanied by a rapid loss of air pressure.

                <div><strong>When is Blowout Season&#63;</strong> Blowouts typically occur Mid-May through early October when the weather is hottest and motorists are traveling for work or holiday. The combination of  increased travel, faster road speeds, and increased vehicle load, can push a neglected or injured tire beyond its breaking point.
