                <div class="mb-2">Air filters clean the air that comes inside the car’s cabin through the ventilation and air conditioning system. During springtime, this incoming air contains pollen, dust, dander and other contaminants that can make the experience uncomfortable for anyone, especially those with respiratory issues or allergies.

                <div>Spring is a great time to replace your old air filters. Here are a few more reasons to change the air filters in your BMW&#58;

                    <l class="list-item-heading">No Pollution</l><br>
                    <l>The filter is essentially a screen between the air outside and the interior of your car. It can block smog, dirt, and smoke left behind by other vehicles, keeping this pollution from entering your vehicle. But this takes a toll on the filter and it has to be replaced periodically to keep the pollutants out.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Blocks Debris From Entering The Vehicle</l><br>
                    <l>You don’t see the twigs, leaves, and other rubbish in your car, but that’s because the air-filter is keeping it all outside. If you often park your car in areas with trees and bushes, chances are that you will find quite a lot of debris clogging the air filters. This is why it is important to clean it every month and replace it in spring to keep the debris out.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Reduces Exposure To Allergens</l><br>
                    <l>Since air filters keep pollen from entering your car, it accumulates at the filter barrier, thus reducing its effectiveness over time. If you live in areas with oak trees, pollen could be a significant problem for you. By replacing your vehicle’s air filter before spring every year, you can keep pollen from ever getting in your vehicle.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Increased Effectiveness</l><br>
                    <l>When an air-filter has been used throughout the year, it has to work much harder in the pollen-heavy spring season, which may cause it to clog up. This can impact your BMW’s fuel efficiency as it has to use more energy to keep the filter working. Replacing it on time can save you a lot of time and money in the long-run.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Reduces Strain On The Blower Motor</l>
                    <l>Older air filters have to work harder to cool the vehicle’s interior. This puts increased strain on the blower motor and can be avoided with a simple filter replacement.</l>
