                <div class="mb-2">Changing seasons &#45; and subsequently, the weather &#45; has a significant impact on your tires. For instance, while tire pressure drops during cold weather, excessive heat can cause them to temporarily inflate.

                <div>Here’s how the following seasonal variations can affect your BMW tires&#58;

                    <l class="list-item-heading">Heat</l><br>
                    <l>Every time the temperature goes up 10 degrees, tire pressure increases by one psi. Warm weather and extreme humidity can lead to overinflated tires that are prone to punctures while you drive.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Cold</l><br>
                    <l>It is essential to keep an eye on tire pressure even when it’s cold outside. A 10-degree temperature drop can decrease the pressure by 1 to 2 psi; this has an impact on your car’s handling and traction – it can even affect the life of your tires.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Road Temperature</l><br>
                    <l>When asphalt or cobblestone roads get hot, they expand and cause increased friction. As a result, tires heat up and overinflate due to increased air pressure inside.</l>
