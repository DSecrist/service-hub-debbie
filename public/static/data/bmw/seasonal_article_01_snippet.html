                    <l class="list-item-heading">Winter Tires</l><br>
                    <l>Having tires that are especially designed to drive through the months of winter is one of the best decisions you can make &#45; remember, always opt for original BMW parts and tires as opposed to aftermarket products. Our BMW Certified Technicians check your winter tires tread depth &amp; tire pressure.</l><br><br>
                     
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Heating Systems</l><br>
                    <l>Before winter comes in full swing, always make sure that you check the condition of your heater. During sweltering spring and summer months, we generally do not bother to check up on the status of our heating systems. Which can result in commuting in a cold car on the first frosty day of the year.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Windshield</l><br>
                    <l>Often times, your windshield can take quite a beating during harsh weather, if your windshield has small cracks or chips, they can be made worse. If you think your windshield is not in good condition, then bring it to BMW Certified Technicians for a thorough check up.</l><br>
