                <div>Your vehicle’s brakes are responsible for slowing and stopping the thousands of pounds of metal you’re driving; it’s important that they function properly. Here are 5 easy ways to identify the signs of poor brake performance.

                <ul>
                    <l class="list-item-heading">High Pitched Squealing</l><br>
                    <l>If you hear a high-pitched squealing when you apply pressure to your brakes, this is likely the metal shim outside your brake pad. This is a sign of worn brakes.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Grinding or Scraping Noise</l><br>
                    <l>Just like squealing sounds, grinding indicates ater stage of brake depreciation indicating the outer metal surface of the brake pad is now rubbing against the rotor.Take care of this issue immediately, as it may lead to rotor damage.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Pulling To One Side</l><br>
                    <l>Does your vehicle pull to one side when the brakes are applied? If so, this indicates one brake pad or rotor is worn down more than the other side, and can be a serious issue when emergency maneuvers are needed.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Pedal Vibrations</l><br>
                    <l>Should your brake pedal (or entire car) vibrate when you’re slowing or stopping, pad or rotor wear can be the cause.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Pressing the Brake Just Doesn't Seem Right</l><br>
                    <l>Sometimes pushing on the brake pedal just doesn’t feel right. If the pedals are too stiff, too spongy, or sinks close to the floor when pressed, these may be signs of brakes wear.</l><br>
