                </div><br>
                
                <div>The <strong>Flat Tire Monitor (FTM)</strong> measures the changes in each tire’s rolling radius and rotational spins. A flat tire can significantly change the readings. Your FTM system detects these variations and alerts the driver.

                <div>The <strong>Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM)</strong> system keeps track of inflation through a pressure sensor that’s installed in each of the tires.

                    <l>Seasonal conditions like changing air pressure and road temperature can have a direct effect on the internal pressure of your vehicle’s tires. If temperatures have remained relatively stable, a slow leak may be more likely.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Flat Tire</l><br>
                    <l>It is essential to keep an eye on tire pressure even when it’s cold outside. A 10-degree temperature drop can decrease the pressure by 1 to 2 psi; this has an impact on your car’s handling and traction – it can even affect the life of your tires.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Monitor Malfunction</l><br>
                    <l>Pressure sensors in each tire can wear down over time. This general wear and tear to cause the monitor to wear down and misread tire pressure.</l>

                <div>It’s important <strong>not to ignore the TPMS warning light</strong> because an underinflated or flat tire can jeopardize your safety. Even minimal underinflation will cause a tire to bend and flex more than usual causing it to wear faster. Additionally, low-pressure tires have a significant impact on your BMW’s fuel efficiency. For every 1 PSI a tire is underinflated, it can <strong>reduce gas efficiency by 0.3%</strong>.

                <div>When sudden drops in temperature cause the TPMS light to come on, the light will turn off automatically once the car acclimates to the new weather condition.
