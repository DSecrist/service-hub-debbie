                    <l class="list-item-heading">Limit Short Drives</l><br>
                    <l>A quick drive prevents your battery from recharging fully. If you only drive short distances, there's a higher chance of your battery dying on you.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Turn Off All Your Lights</l><br>
                    <l>If your vehicle has automatic lights, you should be in good shape. If it doesn’t or you don’t use them, making it a habit to turn off every light before exiting your vehicle is one of the easiest ways to extend your battery life.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Visual Check of Battery Connections</l><br>
                    <l>Hot weather can speed up corrosion at the battery terminals and adjoining components. Battery terminals need to be kept clean of all debris and deposits. Simply opening the hood and doing a quick visual inspection of the battery terminals will help you identify issues before they arise.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Park In Cooler Areas</l><br>
                    <l>High temperatures are detrimental to your battery’s efficiency and overall life. Whenever possible choose to park in a covered area like a parking deck or shaded spot can help prevent increased wear on your vehicle battery. Avoid leaving your vehicle in direct sunlight for long periods. By seeking out cooler surroundings, you can help increase battery life.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Take Good Care of Your BMW</l><br>
