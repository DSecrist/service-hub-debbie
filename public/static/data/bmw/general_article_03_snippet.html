                    <l class="list-item-heading">Replace Filters Often</l><br>
                    <l>You may not realize this, but your vehicle actually has three filters.  You may already be familiar with the engine oil filter. Replacing this at the recommended intervals along with the cabin air filter and fuel filter will keep your vehicle’s value high and increase overall performance.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Battery Performance</l><br>
                    <l>Visual checks of the battery terminals should not show any signs of corrosion or mineral buildup. Our BMW Certified Technicians suggest checking your battery twice a year and recharging it if necessary.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Use Original BMW Engine Oil</l><br>
                    <l>Another way to maintain your BMW’s performance is by using Original BMW Engine Oil. Other brands may increase the number of engine contaminants and reduce its efficiency over time.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Keep Your Vehicle Clean</l><br>
                    <l>Regularly washing your BMW will keep it looking good, but a clean exterior has additional benefits. Removing contaminants like tree sap or bird droppings from the vehicle body will prevent corrosion or damage to the exterior. Leaving these contaminants for too long will break down the finish and begin damaging the paint beneath.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Top-Off or Replace Fluids</l><br>
                    <l>Top-off windshield wiper fluid at regular intervals and don’t forget to ask for your brake fluid levels to be checked. If you feel reduced pressure when stepping on the brake pedal it may be time for a fluid change.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Regular Brake Maintenance</l><br>
                    <l>Regular brake maintenance includes checking the wear levels on your front and rear brake pads, inspecting the rotors for any issues, and checking brake fluid levels.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Tire Inspections</l><br>
                    <l>Regular inspections of tires can prevent blowouts. Our certified technicians will adjust your tire pressure, check the tread levels, and make sure your tires are road ready.</l><br>
