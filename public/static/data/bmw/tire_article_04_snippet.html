                    <l class="list-item-heading">Maintained Tire Pressure</l><br>
                    <l>All tires possess microscopic pores that permit any filling material to escape gradually over time. This is normal and essential to getting the best performance out of your tires long term. Pure nitrogen gas has slightly larger molecules than that of air, which means your tire maintains optimal inflation pressure for a longer period. Nitrogen gas is able to withstand extreme weather conditions and allows better control over tire pressure.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Extended Tire and Wheel Life</l><br>
                    <l>Pure nitrogen, an unreactive gas, differs from air because it does support rust formation due to oxidation which can be common in older wheelbases. Untimely wheel erosion and tire wear can be kept at bay for longer periods.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Consistent Fuel Economy</l><br>
                    <l>Flatter tires can decrease your vehicle’s overall fuel economy. Nitrogen fill tires do not magically increase your vehicle’s fuel economy but do allow for more consistent optimal efficiency.  Compared to air which can lose one to two PSI per month, nitrogen tires lose ⅓ to ⅔ PSI per month. In both types, a drop of 1 psi in all four tires produces a 0.3% reduction in gas mileage.</l><br>
