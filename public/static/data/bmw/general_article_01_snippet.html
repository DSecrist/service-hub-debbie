        If you spend a significant amount of your time driving in a heavily
        populated urban area or commuting to and from a city, you should
        consider servicing your BMW more frequently. BMW suggests two different
        maintenance schedules that vary based on where you live: urban or rural
        environment.

        City driving can have unintended negative impacts on your vehicle,
        resulting in increased wear and tear. The best way to keep your vehicle
        in top driving condition, is to service it more frequently.

          >Potholes tend to be more prevalent in urban areas. Driving on rough
          or uneven surfaces will undoubtedly impact vehicle performance over
          time. A pothole can reduce the effectiveness of your vehicle’s
          suspension system, cause misaligned tires, or wear tires faster on one
          side of the car compared to the other.</l

          >While we don’t look forward to getting caught in stop-and-go traffic
          on our morning commute, our vehicle is designed to handle it. What you
          may not know is the constant tensile stress of acceleration and
          deceleration can increase the rate of oil consumption and increase the
          rate at which your brakes wear over time. Have a general maintenance
          service every eight to twelve months is the best solution to keep your
          BMW city ready.</l

          idle periods. When your vehicle’s engine idles for long periods of
          time (waiting for traffic lights, gridlock traffic, accidents, etc.)
          your oil life is reduced at a faster rate. Make it a regular habit to
          check your oil life percentage to help plan for an upcoming oil
          change.</l
