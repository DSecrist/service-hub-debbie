                    <l>Weather conditions during autumn can lead to musty smells in the car’s cabin. Often, a dirty and overworked air filter is the main culprit. By changing it on time, you can also protect yourself and other passengers from breathing in mold and mildew.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">No Plant Debris</l><br>
                    <l>Pine needles, leaves, twigs, acorns and other debris are often found lying across the roads during autumn. The air filter keeps these outside the car. However, over time a build-up of plant debris clogs the filter.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Increased Airflow</l><br>
                    <l>A clogged air filter restricts the flow of air to the AC system, which puts additional strain on the blower motor. A clean filter can not only increase the airflow into the cabin, but also ensure that your blower motor is not put under too much pressure.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Quality Air</l><br>
                    <l>Even if the airflow is strong, an older air filter might still have difficultly cleaning the air. For better air quality inside your BMW, you should always ensure that your air filter is clean by replacing it regularly.</l>
