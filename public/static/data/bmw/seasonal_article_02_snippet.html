                <div>Summers can be especially tough on cabin air filters as they have to work overtime to keep passengers protected from the hot, humid, and dirty air outside. Here are five reasons you should replace your BMW’s air filter&#58;

                    <l class="list-item-heading">Frequent City Driving</l><br>
                    <l>Driving in heavy traffic in urban areas can wreak havoc on the air filter as it has to work overtime to keep you safe from poor air quality, dust, smog, and road debris. City driving can reduce the effectiveness of your air filter at a faster rate.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Road Debris</l><br>
                    <l>Even if you don’t live in the city, just driving around can eventually clog up the filters. Larger debris such as twigs, dried-up leaves, and even twigs can get caught up in it.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Smog</l><br>
                    <l>Pollutants and other contaminants can enter the ventilation system and make the air inside the cabin unbreathable. The filter acts as a screen between passengers and the smog outside – and so, it should be replaced regularly.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Micro-organisms</l><br>
                    <l>Micro-organisms and mold in the air can accumulate inside the cabin and multiply quickly. Consider changing the air filter, if your cabin begins to smell musty.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Cools the Cabin Better</l><br>
                    <l>A clean air filter obviously does a much better, and of course, faster job at cooling your BMW; a necessity in the hot summer months.</l>
