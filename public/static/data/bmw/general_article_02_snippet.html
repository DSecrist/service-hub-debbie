                    <l>Checking your brake system, including the brake pad and rotor, to ensure that it is in optimum working condition.</l><br><br>

                    <l>Inspecting the tires for pressure and tread. Underinflated tires can reduce your fuel economy while worn-out tires need a wheel alignment more often than necessary.  BMW Certified Technicians will check for bald spots and bulges on all four tires and suggest the right solution.</l><br><br>

                    <l>Double-check the coolant levels and refill them as necessary. Also replace air filters to ensure that your A/C continues blowing air free of debris.</l><br><br>
