                    <l>Because a bird’s diet often consists of tree fruits or berries, bird droppings are highly acidic. This means if they are left unchecked, their corrosive nature can breakdown the finish on your vehicle. Tree sap is another contaminant that can cause permanent damage to the exterior of your BMW.  Over time tree sap or bird dropping will strip away the finish and can begin to damage the paint below.</l><br><br>

                    <l>Wash your vehicle regularly to remove road debris, bird droppings, tree sap, and other contaminants from the exterior.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Use Mild Solvents Only</l><br>
                    <l>If you choose to wash the vehicle yourself, make sure you select the right supplies. A soft muslin cloth, and a sponge with mild cleaning solution is all that you need. Avoid harsh solvents to prevent potential damage to the paint and finish.</l><br><br>
                    
                    <l class="list-item-heading">Don't Forget The Polish</l><br>
                    <l>An easy way to brighten any vehicles exterior is with a finishing coat of wax or polish. Car polish not only enhances your BMW’s outer appearance by gently cleans the paint surface, but it preserves and shields it against harsh environmental conditions or road/foliage debris.</l><br><br>
